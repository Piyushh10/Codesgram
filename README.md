## Architecture

Codesgram uses a robust, scalable architecture:

- **MVVM Pattern:** Separation of UI, business logic, and data
- **Jetpack Compose:** Declarative UI framework
- **Firebase:** Authentication, Realtime Database for chat and user data
- **Retrofit:** For RESTful API calls to LeetCode endpoints
- **Repository Pattern:** Abstracts data sources (network, database)
- **ViewModels:** Manage UI-related data and handle business logic

[Remote API (LeetCodeApiService)]   [Firebase (Auth, Realtime DB)]
```
</details>

## User Flow

1. **Sign In:** User authenticates via Google
2. **Onboarding:** User enters LeetCode username (if first time)
3. **Home:** User lands on chat or group chat screen
4. **Profile:** User can view/edit their profile and see LeetCode stats
5. **Chat:** User can send/receive messages in real-time (personal or group)
6. **LeetCode Stats:** User can view their coding progress, recent submissions, and contest ratings

---

## LeetCode Integration

- Uses a custom backend proxy to fetch LeetCode data securely
- Endpoints include: user profile, badges, solved problems, contest details, submissions, language stats, and more
- Data is fetched using Retrofit and displayed in real-time in the app
